# BOOM-Python-Scripts
Plotting scripts for BOOM data processing.

Alright, so I figured out how to make a collaborative Jupyter notebook, but that doesn't seem like it will work as well as I had hoped, so this Repo exists.
Editing the same file will be a massive conflict headache, so I think it's better if we have at least two distinct files. Try not to edit one you didn't make or wasn't assigned to you.
